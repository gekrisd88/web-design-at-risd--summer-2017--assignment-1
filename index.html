	<h4>Salvador Dali</h4>
		<ul>
			<div>
							<p>Dalí was a skilled draftsman, best known for the striking and bizarre 
							images in his surrealist work. His painterly skills are often attributed 
							to the influence of Renaissance masters. 
							His best-known work, <strong>The Persistence of Memory</strong>, was completed 
							in August 1931. Dalí’s expansive artistic répertoire included film, sculpture, 
							and photography, in collaboration with a range of artists in a variety of media.</p></ul>
